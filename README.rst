This repository is for deep per-package testing.
The only pull requests accepting here is about continuous integration testing on Travis/AppVeyor, i.e. should only affect ``.travis.yml`` or ``appveyor.yml`` (in some rare cases ``jenkins.py``). Please contribute other stuff to https://github.com/ruslo/hunter.

Thanks.
